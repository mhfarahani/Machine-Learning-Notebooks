# Machine-Learning-Notebooks

A series of machine learning exercises

## Don't Get Kicked!:

Don’t Get Kicked! was a Kaggle competition in 2011. The challenge in this problem is to identify if a used vehicle purchased in auction is a “kick” or not. A kicked vehicle is defined as a car with serious problems that needs a lot of investment to fix the problem before selling it to costumers. Auto dealerships frequently attend auctions to purchase used cars. There is a chance that the purchased car would have serious unseen mechanical or electrical problem that prevent it from being sold to costumers. These problems may be very costly and result in market losses. A link to the competition page is:

## Creating Customer Segments:

A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week. Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries — losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. This notebook looks the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. The task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

• Python 2.7
• NumPy
• pandas
• scikit-learn (v0.17)
• matplotlib
• Scipy
